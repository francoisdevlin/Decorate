# decorators

This is an independant decorator library I've created in order to demonstate the power
of decorators.  It is made up of the following parts

* decorate.core - This is where the core decorator forms are stored
* decorate.invokable - This is where definvoke is stored.  Contributed by Meikel Brandmeyer
* decorate.same - The same protocol
* decorate.common
