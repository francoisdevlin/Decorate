# decorators

This is an independant decorator library I've created in order to demonstate the power
of decorators.  It is made up of the following parts

* decorators.core - This is where the core decorator forms are stored
* decorators.invokable - This is where definvoke is stored.  Contributed by Meikel Brandmeyer
* decorators.same - The same protocol
* decorators.common - Includes common decorators, such as logging, validating, coercing.  Also includes the word-like protocol.
